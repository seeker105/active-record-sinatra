when running rake it relys on knowing which environment we are in


which file accesses. the .yml file? The rake(I think)


The rake commands rely on the .yml file to know which database we are talking about


'development' 'test' and 'production' are words that matter to rake


rake db:create_migration NAME=create_films
creates migration folder if it does not exist.
creates a 'CreateFilms' class; migration file in the migrate folder
creates it as an inheritor of ActiveRecord::Migration
